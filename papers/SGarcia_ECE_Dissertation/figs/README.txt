NOTE: The 'MU TH Update' image can be used to show an example of how the 
acceleration THs are updated (before and after plots). This is example was 
taken from the Optitrack set:

User: AbnerAyala
Date: 10.08.2014
Game: 4
Traj: 4

The following are the TH values progression throughout the different 
iterations.

4) TH_upper = 0.000000 ; TH_lower = 0.000000
3) TH_upper = 0.049495 ; TH_lower = 0.000000
2) TH_upper = 0.049495 ; TH_lower = -0.079461
2) TH_upper = 0.049495 ; TH_lower = -0.090273
1) TH_upper = 0.657126 ; TH_lower = -0.090273

Decided to have a few example comparison images between the user's and 
model's trajectories. The following are what they belong to:
